      <h1 className="page-heading">Understanding Menstruation Pain</h1>
      <p className="page-paragraph">
        Menstruation, often referred to as a woman's "period," is a natural physiological process
        that most women experience on a monthly basis. It is a crucial aspect of the female
        reproductive system, involving the shedding of the uterine lining in the absence of
        pregnancy.
      </p>
      <p className="page-paragraph">
        Alongside menstruation, many women also experience menstrual pain, also known as
        dysmenorrhea. This pain can range from mild discomfort to severe cramps and is often
        accompanied by various symptoms such as bloating, fatigue, and mood swings.
      </p>
      <p className="page-paragraph">
        Menstrual pain is a unique and personal experience, and its intensity varies among women.
        Some may barely notice it, while others may find it challenging to engage in daily activities.
        It's essential to recognize that menstruation and its associated discomfort are normal
        physiological processes that women navigate throughout their lives.
      </p>
      <p className="page-paragraph">
        Understanding menstruation and its pain is crucial for promoting empathy and support
        for women. By acknowledging the naturalness of this process, we can foster a more
        compassionate and informed perspective on women's health.
