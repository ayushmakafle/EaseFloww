"Hello Mai, how are you?","Hello, nice to meet you. Thank you for asking, I am doing amazing, I hope you are doing good too!"
"Yes I am, thank you","So, how can I help you?"
I don't know anything about Infraradian Rhythm. Can you please help me learn about it?,"Sure. The infradian rhythm is one of the two internal timekeepers experienced by women. People with male physiology only experience the circadian rhythm. People with female physiology experience both. The infradian rhythm and its four phases track with your menstrual cycle, and alongside affecting the reproductive hormones, it also has an influence the other parts of your body. The infradian rhythm affects our physiology cyclically which is why it supports your body in a cyclical way too. As a woman yourself, in order to have optimal hormonal and overall health, it is ideal that you eat, move, supplement and live in line with this infradian rhythm, which is expressed in your mesntrual cycle in four distinct phases, namely the follicular, ovulatory, luteal and menstrual phase."
What happens to my body when I am in the menstrual phase I want to know what happens to my body when I am in the menstrual phase,"Thank you for asking that! A few changes happen. The corpus luteum  it is a vital yet temporary organ that plays a crucial role in fertility in your body gets reabsorbed. Simultaneously, progesterone levels decline, your uterus sheds the thick endometrial lining that it has built up in the luteal phase and estrogen hits its lowest point just before your bleed"
Does any changes occur in my brain too?,"Yes, it does! The left analytical and right feeling hemispheres of your brain communicate the most during this time, which means its a great time to integrate how you feel about situations in your life and make decisions about how to proceed. This is an ideal time to reflect and journal. "
When does the Follicular Phase happen,Your follicular phase happens 7 to 10 days after your period ends. 
How does my body change during the follicular phase,"A few changes occur. Your reproductive hormones are at their lowest level which is where they were during your bleed during the first part of this phase. Estrogen starts to ramp up during the later part of this phase and the lining of your uterus starts to thicken. Your ovaries get ready to release an egg during ovulation the next phase, metabolism is slower and resting cortisol levels are lower. No significant progesterone or testosterone production during this time and you can feel a little tired during this phase if your hormones are unbalanced."
What happens to my brain when I am in my follicular phase,"The subtle increase in estrogen has you interested in planning out new things and exploring new ideas during this time. Symbolically, this is a phase of new beginnings. "
When does the Ovulatory Phase happen,"It happens 3 to 4 days in the middle of your cycle, right after the follicular phase which lasts for 7 to 10 days and before the luteal phase which is the phase just before your period."
What happens to my body when I am in the ovulatory phase,A few changes occur in your body. Estrogen surges and luteinizing hormone LH arrives on the scene to spark the release of an egg. The lining of your uterus gets thicker and testosterone surges then quickly goes back down
What happens to my brain when I am in the ovulatory phase,"The hormone shift during this phase activates the verbal and social areas of your brain. Youre apt to feel your most social and communicative during this phase, and it is a good time to plan conversations with friends and significant others. "
i do not remember the next phase after the ovulatory phase,"Don't worry, I am here to tell you. The luteal phase is the phase that happens after ovulation"
How long does it lasts,It happens 10 to 14 days after ovulation and before your bleed.
What happens to my body when I am in the luteal phase,"A few changes occur in your body. Estrogen levels continue to rise, your uterine lining continues to thicken and your progesterone levels start to rise. Toward the end of the luteal phase, estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone peak and then begin to drop, hitting their lowest levels just before your period. Pre Menstrual Syndrome during this phase is caused by too much estrogen in the body relative to progesterone, or estrogen dominance and metabolism speeds up."
Does my brain change in this phase too?,"Yes, it does. In fact, your brain goes through changes in every phase. Hormone levels during this phase prime your brain to be good at focusing on details and wrapping up projects. Towards the end of this phase, as your hormone levels plummet, you will have less energy and feel more inclined to focus inward rather than on socializing. "
Thank you,No problem
Hi,"Hello I am Mai, nice to meet you."
I was having insomnia and the following week I got my periods. Is there any link between them?,"The week before your periods, if you have too much estrogen relative to progesterone, you can experience PMS premenstrual syndrome symptoms, including insomnia. Estrogen dominance is triggered by a long list of common factors, including stress, lack of selfcare, poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, and exposure to environmental toxins. Some common environmental factors make the situation even worse. Drinking caffeine is one. If you have adrenal fatigue, you may experience PMSrelated insomnia, where you lay in bed exhausted but cant fall asleep. Micronutrient deficiencies, including low levels of magnesium, zinc, andor selenium can also fuel the problem. Magnesium helps promote relaxation; selenium may help boost progesterone and bring your reproductive hormones back into balance; studies show that zinc can help improve sleep quantity and quality. "
Why does my khala go through insomnia before her periods but I don't,"The hormone imbalance is made worse if your progesterone levels are low overallwhich can affect women of every age, but which happens more often to women over age 35. If your khala is older than 35, then this may be it. Thats because overall progesterone levels start trending downward during perimenopause, and lower progesterone negatively impacts the production of melatonin, which is required to fall asleep and stay asleep. Progesterone also promotes relaxation, and without enough of it, you will have trouble falling asleep easily. Progesterone is good for sleep."
"This actually made me think, what classifies as a normal, healthy or perfect period?","Your cycle should last 2632 days. Your bleed should be the color of cranberry juice, with no clots. A nice, strong, flow that isnt inconveniently heavy. Your period should really start first thing in the morning, without any brown stains leading up to the appearance of that cranberry red. And it should last 47 days, not longer or shorter. You should be able to feel your uterus in action with some slight sensations or warm feelings, but there should not be any kind of pain that might have you reaching for drugs or hot water bottles. After your period, leading up to ovulation, you should see the development of cervical fluid, which is an indicator of healthy fertility and necessary for getting pregnant. "
"My periods have stopped coming, but I am not married. Is something wrong with me?","There are some wellknown, textbook reasons that periods disappear, like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.Theres also engaging in too much exercise. As you may know, too much of anything is never healthy. Extreme exercise can lead to hormonal imbalance, so can eating too little andor being underweight. Finally, a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome PCOS, in which cysts grow on your ovaries, can stop ovulation in young women.One of the top triggers for missing periods is coming off hormonal birth control. And stopping the pill doesnt guarantee that your period will come right back. In fact, without making a concentrated effort through food and lifestyle modifications, many women who quit the pill do not start bleeding again for months or years."
"I missed my periods and I don't have any of the famous causes, please help I am very scared that something is wrong with me","There are less talked about but no less real causes of missing or irregular periods, including stress. Chronic stress raises cortisol and messes up blood sugar, which disrupts ovulation. Studies also show that women with stressful jobs are at double the risk for anovulation not ovulating and menstrual cycle variability. Other research shows that women with high levels of stress around the time of ovulation have a harder time getting pregnant.The blood sugar roller coasterlining, when your blood sugar is constantly going up and down thanks to eating highsugar and refined carbohydrate foods, can also fuel missing or irregular periods. Imbalanced blood sugar is linked to infertility, and diabetes drugs like Metformin are often prescribed to women with PCOS to trigger ovulation."
"I am tired of not getting my periods, I want it back","Take selfcare seriously. The more stressed you are, the harder you need to work to manage and mitigate stress. Scan your life for stressors you can change, and then do so! The single best way to address blood sugar problems is with food. Emphasize healthy complex and nongluten carbs, eat enough healthy, highquality fats and proteins, and make sure you frontload nonstarchy vegetables in all colors of the rainbow. Go to bed earlier! Hormones are hugely affected by sleep. The 24hour circadian cycle has a direct influence on, and is directly influenced by, our bodies masterlining hormones. When were short on sleep, its almost impossible to get our hormones balanced. So make sleep a priority tonight and every night!."
What causes Pre Menstrual Syndrome?,"Experts believe PMS is triggered in part by cyclical changes in sex hormones each month. Monthly hormone shifts are normal and expected. They happen! But the root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need. As our bodies move through the 28day hormone cycle in this hormonally imbalanced environment, that is when we experience symptoms. If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. Experts also believe that nutrient deficiencies play a role in PMS symptoms. Research has shown a connection between low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium and PMS symptoms. "
"I have a sweet tooth and love eating sweet things, does that contribute to my PMS",Sugar is one of the most inflammatory foods you can eat  and more inflammation means more PMS. Cutting down on sugar is a must when youre trying to tame PMS. 
"You were helpful, bye ","It is my pleasure to help you out. Take care, bye!"
I have questions,"Feel free to ask any questions, I am here to answer them all."
Please tell me if stress contributes to PMS,"We live in a society that places a high value on always being busy. If you ask someone how theyre doing or whats new and they reply, Ive been SO busy, it often sounds as much like a point of pride as it does a complaint. But we need to reverse our stance on stress. Research shows that the higher the level of our perceived stress, the worse our PMSand that stress reduction techniques might be effective nonpharmaceutical interventions for easing PMS. So grab your yoga mat, go out and get some deep breaths surrounded by nature, or make more time for the leisure activity that relaxes you."
What about coffee's contribution?,"Coffee fuels prostaglandin production, and increases the risk of cysts, fibroids, and period pain. Coffee also depletes the body of key hormonebalancing nutrients like magnesium. "
"If woman smoke, will that make their PMS worse?","Smoking is bad for overall health, of course, including hormone balance. Women who smoke are twice as likely to develop PMS. Just say no to cigarettes. "
Do I need to worry about inflammation making my PMS worse?,"Inflammation is a systemwide response to injury or stress, and it can be brought on by a large number of environmental factors, from eating unhealthy foods and being too sedentary to using toxic health and body care products. Prostaglandins are hormonelike substances that control the bodys inflammatory response and experts believe they can trigger many of the symptoms of PMS. Prostaglandin overproduction is why some women get relief by taking NSAIDs like ibuprofen. NSAIDs block the synthesis of prostaglandins."
Is there anything else that contributes to making my PMS worse,"Yes, carrying HIDDEN weight is one of them. While being overweight is associated with a greater risk of PMS, the real problem is how fat you are on the inside, which is not reflected in how much you weigh. You can be skinny on the outside and overweight on the inside, your PMS might be telling you to address internal obesity. You might not be living in sync with your cycle. Research shows that our 28day menstrual cycle affects our brain function, emotions, mood, sensory processing, appetite, and even our perception of pain. If youre not supporting your bodys unique hormonal needs during each of the four phases of the 28day cycle, you wont have healthy, painfree periods."
"I still have a lot of questions, are you sure you want to continue?","Yes sure, this is what I am here to do, that is to answer your questions. This is a safe space and you may ask any questions regarding your menstrual health"
"I don't want to go through PMS, please tell me to get rid of them once and for all","Heres how to arrange your environment to help defeat PMS. Eat low inflammatory foods, like cruciferous vegetables, pastured eggs and pastured animal proteins, and nuts and seeds. Reduce the amount of sugar you eat. Eat pomegranate and small, oily fish that contain high levels of inflammationfighting omega3 fatty acids. Eat organic and clean whenever possible. Give up coffee. If you dont exercise, eat a highsugar diet andor dont have enough phytonutrientrich vegetables on your plate, you might be overweight or obese, which are strongly correlated with PMS. When you start correcting whats going on internally, you can see a reduction in symptoms. In the medical literature, high levels of stress are associated with more severe PMS, try to keep them low."
Why is syncing with your cycle important?,"Yes! All of the biohacks will only get you so far if you dont start to live in accordance with your cycle. Eating and exercising for each weeklong phase of your 28day cycle is the foundation of feeling better and having a symptomfree period. For too long, weve been living the same way day in and day out. This works for men, but not for women. Syncing your cycle will not only fix your period problems, it will help you find more happiness, energy, and success in life. Simply put, tending to your 28day cycle is as important as tending to your 24hour circadian cycle."
 I know that PMS exists but I want to know what are some foods that are considered good to eat?,"Chickpeas a great source of magnesium. They also contain vitamin B6. Kale, broccoli, cauliflower, and other dark leafy greens. All of these contain indole3 carbinol, which helps the liver metabolize excess estrogen and prevent estrogen dominance which is a common hormone imbalance that gives rise to a bunch of period problems, including PMS.Coconut yogurt contains probiotics in the form of live cultures which helps the gut metabolize estrogen and keep hormones balancedSweet potatoes are naturally sweet and can help satisfy your sweet cravings. The vitamin A in sweet potatoes supports the liver as it metabolizes excess estrogen.Bone broth can be a good source of magnesium and calcium, both of which can help alleviate the symptoms of PMS. "
And what if I want to prevent PMS but I don't want to use medicines. Are there any natural supplements?,"Yes there are. Research suggests that magnesium helps alleviate symptoms of PMS, including weight gain, breast tenderness, and bloating. Omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin D3 help promote hormone balance. Vitamin E helps reduce breast premenstrual breast tenderness, according to research. So does vitamin B6!. Alpha Lipoic Acid ALA offers powerful antioxidant support for the liver as it works to metabolize excess estrogen  remember: too much estrogen relative to progesterone can trigger PMS symptoms  and also supports stable blood sugar. Calcium supplements have been shown to help with mood swings during the luteal phase."
"This was really helpful, thank you ","You're very welcome dear, do you have any more questions for me?"
"No, I think I am good. Good bye Mai! Lovely talking to you","Same here! Enjoy the rest of your day, good bye!"
