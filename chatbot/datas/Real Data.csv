But the root cause of the problem is when we have more or less estrogen and progesterone than we need. As our bodies move through the 28day hormone cycle in this hormonally imbalanced environment, that is when we experience symptoms. If you address the underlying hormone imbalance with food and lifestyle, you can erase the symptoms of Pre Menstrual Syndrome. Experts also believe that nutrient deficiencies play a role in PMS symptoms. Research has shown a connection between low levels of vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium and PMS symptoms. "
