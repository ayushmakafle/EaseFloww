Hi Mai,Hey! How can I help you today?
I feel anxious,Why do you feel that way?
Because I dont understand periods,"I understand why you feel that way. Luckily, I am quite knowledgeable in menstruation. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have, I am here for you. "
What is a period?,"A period is the part of the menstrual cycle when a woman bleeds from her vagina for a few days. For most women this happens every 28 days. but it's common for periods to be more or less frequent than this, ranging from day 21 to day 40 of their menstrual cycle."
I got my period and I haven't told my mom yet. It's really hard for me to talk about things like this. I have a lot of questions. What should I do?,"Lots of girls have the same concern. Your mom will be one of your best resources when you have questions about your period, so try to start the conversation yourself! Know that she will be understanding and helpful. Actually, she may be your best friend during this time in your life. Still dont feel like you can talk to your mom? An aunt, friends mom or older sister are also great women to ask."
"Will anyone, like boys or my mom, notice when I have my period?","No  not unless you tell them! If they ask you, its totally up to you to share or not."
Can I ask you more questions about my period?,Yes! Feel free to ask me your questions.
Why am I having it?,"The body produces an egg every month. The uterus lining gets thicker to prepare for a egg that is fertilized in case the woman becomes pregnant. If the egg is not fertilized, the body gets rid of it. The lining is then released from the body as blood through the vagina. This monthly process is called menstruation or a period. So when a girl has her period, her body is just getting rid of a small amount of blood and some unneeded tissue. It is a natural, normal body process for all females as they become women and mature physically."
How long will it last?,"Your period can last between 3 and 8 days, but it will usually last for about 5 days. The bleeding tends to be heaviest in the first 2 days."
Is it a one time occurance?,A period occurs every 21 to 35 days starting from around age 12 and occuring upto age 50.
"What if I have my period twice in one month, is that normal?","Yes, its possible. Why? Some months, your menstrual cycle may last for more or fewer days than the previous month. Or, your cycle may start earlier or later than before. If you usually have a regular cycle, a change in your cycle could indicate a medical condition. In case of any concerns, please talk to your doctor to get individual medical advice."
It seems too difficult to keep track of when it will occur,You can track your period with an app called Clue. It is available on the Playstore. Here is a quick link to the app:https:helloclue.com
"Mine dont occur on those times, they are irregular","Your period is irregular if it comes more frequently than 21 days, or you go 35 days or more between periods."
Why are they irregular?,"Sometimes irregular periods can be caused by some medicines, exercising too much, having a very low or too high body weight, and hormonal imbalances. Please check with your doctor if you feel you have irregular periods. "
How should I treat this?,"For irregular periods there usually is no immediate reason to consult your doctor. But if you are concerned, please do so. If you need contraception your doctor can help you with that by prescribing you hormonal contraceptives which do not only reliably prevent unintended pregnancies but can also stabilize your menstrual cycle so that you can better plan for your periods."
Can these irregularities lead to other health problems?,"The presence of menstrual irregularities can be a sign of other health problems such as thyroid disease, POI, endometriosis, PCOS, polyps, and uterine fibroids If left untreated, menstrual irregularities can lead to or contribute to other conditions. These possible conditions vary depending on the type of menstrual irregularity, but some include thickening of the lining of the uterus called endometrial hyperplasia, low bone density, and irondeficient anemia. It is important for a woman with a menstrual irregularity to speak to a health care provider to determine the cause of the irregularity and to receive appropriate treatment as necessary."
Can they lead to cancer?,"Menstrual irregularities can sometimes be a sign of an underlying condition that may be associated with a higher risk for cancer. However, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding are not known to be associated with cancer."
