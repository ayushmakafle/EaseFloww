Hi Mai,Hello! How are you feeling today?
I feel worried,Why do you feel that way?
I am unable able to get pregnant. I need help.,How long has it been since you started trying to get pregnant?
1 year or less,"If you have just started trying to get pregnant, then there are a few things that could help with your pregnancy and a very important thing is to have sex on your most fertile days. Do you want to know the days on which your chances of pregnancy are higher?"
"Sure, tell me",It is important to map your menstrual cycle every time to find the right time to get pregnant. Ovulation period usually occurs between 12 to 16 days after the previous menstrual cycle and the 4 to 5 days before ovulation is your most fertile window. The ovulation period differs for each woman and monitoring and noting down your ovulation cycle for 3 to 4 consecutive periods will give you a good idea. Having sex on these days could increase the chances of pregnancy by a great margin. Are you having sex on your fertile window but still havent got pregnant?
How do I keep track of my fertile days?,You can check your fertile days with an app called Clue. It is available on the Playstore. Here is a quick link to the app: https:helloclue.com
